# Installation

* Clone the repo.
* Open a new chrome tab and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
* Toggle the `Developer mode` switch to the right of the screen.
* Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the directory where you cloned the repo.

You should be able to pin the extension which will give you a nice button to click in your chrome toolbar.

# Limitations

The extension splits the sprint goals string and will display each "goal" on a separate line.

It will use either the pipe character `|` or a fullstop `.` to do this.

This means when writing your sprint goals, you should use either the pipe character or a fullstop to separate you individual sprint goals.
